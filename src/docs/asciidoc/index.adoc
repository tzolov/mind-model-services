== Introduction

Java libraries for enabling and simplifying the inference of Deep Learning models.

image:{imagesdir}/../reference-arch.png[width=80%, role=right]
Provides Java wrappers for various state-of-the-art deep learning models. To be used in standalone Java
application, https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot[SpringBoot] microservices as well as https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream/[Streaming],
https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-task#learn[Task/Batch] and https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-function/[Serverless] programing models.

The implementations use the https://www.tensorflow.org/install/lang_java[TensorFlow Java API] as well as the
https://deeplearning4j.org/docs/latest/nd4j-overview[DL4J] API stack such as https://github.com/bytedeco/javacv[JavaCV],
https://deeplearning4j.org/docs/latest/nd4j-overview[ND4J] https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/tree/master/nd4j/nd4j-tensorflow[nd4j-tensorflow].

The pre-trained TensorFlow models can be loaded from `classpath`, `file` or `http` resource locations.
Also the models can be loaded directly from their `model-zoo` pages! For this just use the
following URI convention:

----
http://<Model's tar.gz URL>#frozen_inference_graph.pb
----

Where the `frozen_inference_graph.pb` is the frozen model's file name within the archive specified with the URI.
Change the fragment name to match the file name within the model archive you use. The `frozen_inference_graph.pb`
seems to be used by default in many projects.
